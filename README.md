The Synthetic Circle dataset is a collection of 10,000 two-dimensional points arranged into 100 circles, each containing 100 points. The dataset is designed to evaluate clustering algorithms, such as k-means, by providing a clear and structured clustering challenge. Each point is labeled with a class indicating its circle membership, making it suitable for both classification and clustering tasks.

## Key Features
- **Two-Dimensional Points**: Each point has x and y coordinates.
- **Class Labels**: Each point is labeled with a class indicating its circle membership.
- **Structured Clustering Challenge**: 100 circles with 100 points each.
- **Large Dataset**: 10,000 instances for robust analysis.
- **Tabular Format**: Easy to import and process in various data analysis tools.
